# The -namehere- decision making tool

You can use this tool to create pro and con lists with just a few clicks. This is basically just a demo
how to use reactjs and various different libraries. Styling wasn't really a priority, just used Bootstrap.

Running and developing it is really simple

    git clone https://github.com/DBook/Markdist

    npm install

    gulp #(will start the watch task)

    gulp build #(will create all the dist files)


And that is it you can start working on the files and they should be updated directly

Features to come:

- selective sync with server
- Markdown support for the items
- Undo for deleted items
- Better styles
